# KAC - Kerbal Assembly-CSharp.dll Cleaner
A windows mode patchset for deobfuscating Assembly-CSharp.dll (may also work in WINE on other platforms, or you can run de4dot --dont-rename "Path/to/assembly-CSharp.dll" on your native platform).

The project files are a from a propietary binary patcher to avoid legal issues (Indigo Rose Visual Patch).  The exe releases are also from that program.  They are easy to use, download your KSP version and put in the KSP directory root.  Run and enjoy!
