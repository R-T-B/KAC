# KAC - Kerbal Assembly-CSharp.dll Cleaner
A in-game patchset for deobfuscating Assembly-CSharp.dll, which can theoretically have small performance benefits.  It runs once, patches your assembly and then closes forever.

As the measured benefits are very low, this project has been mothballed for reference only.

Non-windows users should have mono installed.
